Note:
During the semester, I learned a lot about collaboration and coding knowledge. And compared to the time invested, it didn't produce many results. That's because I lacked experience and skills. So I thought I should study and code more efficiently. In order to make a better game, I will design the game to consider scope and do object-oriented coding. I appreciated my team members, and it was a meaningful project to grow.
