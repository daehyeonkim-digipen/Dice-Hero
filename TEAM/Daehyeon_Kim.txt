Note
Last semester, I completed GAM100 only enough to get a reasonable score. 
But I didn't come to DigiPen to get points, came to DigiPen to study, and I thought something should be different. 
So I designed the game with great ambition, and considering that it was my first attempt in my life, I think it was made well. 
By choosing the RPG genre, I could learn so much that I had no regrets about whatever grade I got.

However, I often regretted because my team members worked too hard and struggled to produce the results I wanted. 
I don't remember taking a break on the weekend, and I had a big conflict with the team member that she couldn't produce the results I wanted and couldn't keep up with the schedule I made. 
The size of the game was so big that it was hard to explain it within the time limit for each presentation, and I was criticized by professors every time, and my determination to accept students in need as a team and help them grow up together turned into scolding them.

All the ideas were made by me, or I got involved. 
When I heard compliments, I became everyone's, but when I was pointed out, I felt like I was responsible for myself, and I blamed myself dozens of times. 
Even at this moment of submission, I feel guilty that I might not be able to help my friends' grades, and that I might not be able to give a corresponding grade to a friend who trusted me and made high-quality coding.
I can throw away my greed for my own grades, but I can't throw away my fear of damaging others' grades.

I think maybe the most learned thing is leadership. 
Hasty ambition makes me blame myself for making my team members suffer and my team members suffer. 
In this semester's GAM150, I learned that studying without regrets is important, but teamwork should not be ruled out.
